Availability

A fraction of time/probability that our service is operationally functional and available to the user


Calculating Availability (in %)
	- Availability Formula 1
		- Uptime: time that our system is operationally functional and available to the user
		- Downtime: time that our systime is not available
		- Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

	- Availability Formula 2
		- MTBF: Mean Time Between Failures
			- Average time that our system is operational
			- Useful when:
				- Dealing with different pieces of hardware
				- Each component has its own operational shelf life
		- MTTR: Mean Time To Recovery
			- Average time it takes the system to detect and recover from a failure
			- Average Downtime of the system
		- Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
		- This formula is:
			- More statistics-based and talks about probabilities
			- More suitable for availability estimation, rather than measurement
			- Shows us the importance of fast detection and recovery to achieve high availability


What is considered High Availability?
	- Users want 100%
	- Very hard to achieve from engineering point of view
		Leaves no time for maintenance and upgrades
	- No strict definition for HA
	- Industry Standard: between 99-100%
		- Cloud vendors offer 99.9% or higher
	99%:
		- Daily downtime: 15m
		- Weekly downtime: 1h 40m
		- Monthly downtime: 7h 18m
		- Annual Downtime: 3d 15h 36m
	99.9%:
		- Daily downtime: 1m 30s
		- Weekly downtime: 10m
		- Monthly downtime: 43m
		- Annual Downtime: 8h 45m
