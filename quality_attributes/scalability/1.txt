Scalability

The measure of system's ability to handle a growing amount of work,
in an easy and cost-effective way, by adding resources to the system

Load vs Resources
	- Ideally we want to have Linear Scalability
	  (when adding x amount of resource equates in y increase in performance)
	- In reality that is very difficult to achieve
		- Adding resouces produces logarithmic increase in performance
		- There is some increase in performance with more reouces,
		  but it evens out and may even start degrading as we keep adding more
		- Adding resources also increases resource management overhead,
		  which may offset performance gains and even lead to performance degradation
