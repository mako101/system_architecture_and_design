System Performance Objectives

1. Minimize Request-Response Latency
	- measured in time units
	- Depends on:
		- Wait/Idle time (time the request spends waiting to be processed,
		  once submitted)
		- Processing time (time it takes to actually process the request)

2. Maximize Throughput

	- Measured as a rate of x requests in a given time

	Depends on:
		- Latency -> How to minimize latency?
		- Capacity
