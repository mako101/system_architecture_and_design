What is perfomance?
A measure of how fast/responsive a system is:
	- Under a given workload
		- amount of backed data to query/process
		- a volume of requests to handle
	- On a given set of hardware
		- hardware type and capacity


What are performance problems?
They are a result of a QUEUE building up somewhere.
Queue is a bunch of requests that are not getting processed fast enough
Types of queue:
	- Network Socket queue
	- Database IO queue
	- OS run queue
	...

Why do queues occur?
3 main reasons:
	- Inefficient/slow processing
	  (the code that does the request processing is slow)
	- Serial resource access
	  (new requests are piling up while waiting for the current one to be completed)
	- Limited resource capacity
	  (slow hardware running at max capacity)
