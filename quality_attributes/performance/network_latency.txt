Network Latency

	- Cost of establishing connections
		- Handshake with the router
		- Setting up SSL/TLS encryption


Reducing Network Latency

	- Connection Pools
		- Reusing already established connections

	- Persistent Connections (Browsers do this automatically)
		- A connection that is maintained for some time
		  after the last call to the server is complete

	- Caching
		- Session/Query Data from backend/DB
		- Static web data
		- SSL Session Caching (?)
			- If a server detects that the same client is trying to establish SSL session,
			  they can agree to reuse an existing session

	- Efficient data tranfser formats
		- Using RPC calls instead of http where possible
		- BUT: using RPC reduces interoperability/compatibility between services


	- Using data compression to reduce the sise of data trasnfer
		- Overhead of compressing data server-size and uncompressing the data client-side
		- Needs some extra CPU cycles, but much lower overhead than larger data transfer
